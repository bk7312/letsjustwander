## In a nutshell:

> A ridiculous blog that is not personal finance, not freely independent, and not environmentally sane.
> Heck, what is?

## In a coconut shell:


If you ever thought:

"What if there was a way to look inside the mind of a \<insert-great-noble-term\> person piecing together some efficient way to be free from mundane life?"

Then you've come to the wrong place.

What you'll be getting instead is:

- nonsensical Zen/[Chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chan_Buddhism)-like advice that goes nowhere
- a geography PhD student in New Zealand experimentally combining too many sub-sub-disciplines.
- some Asian dude who can't give you a straight answer to the question "Where are you from?" even though he studies geography (see above).
- what seems like a personal finance blog but reads more like philosophy/psychology.
- occasional stories from this introvert's conversation with people (read: 95% listening, 5% talking).

Anyways, if you can imagine a Venn diagram, consider this blog an intersection of several unconventional methods bordering on conspiracy.
It brings together poorly referenced ideas, lots of secondhand anecdotes, hazy memories from ages ago and lots of wannabee new-age buzzwords in a read-at-your-own-risk manner.

Or maybe, just maybe, this is someone who likes resolving a good paradox.

- Earth is warming, Antarctic ice is sliding, sea level is rising ...
- We work 9-5, get stuck in traffic and office jobs, go home tired ...

The planet deserves saving.
Our standard of living requires preserving.
Yet time is a wasting.

Well let's go [eco-friendly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentally_friendly)!
Quit the [Moonlight clan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_clan)!
And get [FIRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement)d up!

I hope that some bit of this blog can spark an idea in you.

An idea that will turn you from a "Go away, I'm busy" workaholic.

To a "I have time, how can I help?" human.

That's all there is.
