title: A little goes a long way
---

There were once many befores, and later there will be many afters.
It depends on what you're after, which follows from what history you had before.
Choices be made, habits play along, consequences arise, now ein't that a poem.

What appears to be uncontrollable, may simply be a matter not controlled until it was too late.
But why blame the past, why tame the present, why lament the future?

Life can be seen as a tradeoff sometimes.

- Money or Freedom
- Health or Desire
- Chocolate or Strawberry

Now the *clever* ones reading this will know to combine the two extremes.
Forming grey between black and white (or maybe chocolate strawberry ice cream).
Why choose one when there is a third way?

Yes, technology has and can solve a lot of things.
Once difficult things become ever so easy with:

- a click
- a swipe
- a voice activation,
- maybe one day - a mere thought.

It is the thought which drives the mind, which drives the action.
The action be the sound or gesture.
Capture the thought, and you capture the world.

> Thoughtful ideas that combine two seemingly disparate concepts are so much the rage these days.

Really, like I should know better.
As though my PhD is on combining some niche scientific field with cool technology.

Anyhow, aren't there some *wise* ones that see past this crap.
People who perhaps, don't see why a choice has to be made in the first place.
Sure, like put down that chocolate strawberry ice cream!

Easy for some, not for others.
Tell this to someone who has:

- Built up a career and reputation
- Created an empire of health products
- [A chocolate factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Wonka_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory)

Maybe let's take a step back.

Think about it, the more you start to think about it, you might start to fall into it.
Call it curiousity, addiction, falling down a rabbit hole.
A little goes a long way~

Stop or go, you've been warned.

As for this little blog, I guess I'll be hanging around this 'internet' for a while.

Now let's think, what's next?
