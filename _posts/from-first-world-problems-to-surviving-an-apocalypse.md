title: From first world problems to surviving an apocalypse
---

It's hard to know how privilleged you are sometimes.
Especially when you could be like me, having a top floor (shared) office with an amazing view of the harbour.

So let's put things to numbers.
Use [this](http://www.globalrichlist.com/) to answer the question:
Are you in the [1%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_are_the_99%25)?
Go on, I'll wait.

Back?
Great.

It's ironic now that I think of it.
A little over a month ago, I was in the 1%, earning a mere graduate salary in my old corporate office job, minus the great harbour view since we couldn't afford the top floor (yet).

Now I'm hovering somewhere between 2% to 3%.
Living with a stipend and some part-time gigs to sustain my so-called 'poor' student life.
But hey, at least there's a good harbour view now (on a good day)!

Instead of lunches with colleageus often talking about property (or kids), I now sit around fellow academics talking about [fake-news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news) and other first world problems.
Or real world problems like sea level rise from melting polar ice sheets.

It really depends on the day.

And well, just two days ago, the topic somehow spun to this '[Survival of the Richest](https://medium.com/s/futurehuman/survival-of-the-richest-9ef6cddd0cc1)' story.
How five super-rich guys (yes, all men) wanted to protect themselves from 'The Event'.
Billionaires who couldn't care less about the rest of the planet, wanting to protect themselves from climate change, zombies, nuclear fallouts and whatnot.

It was like a whole new level on the 'first world problems' scale.
I knew about people wanting to start a Mars colony, but I can't help but wonder:
Are they doing it for science, or is it just an escape route away from Earth's problems?

Bias disclosure: I'm affilliated with an 'Earth Science' department at this moment in writing.
The thoughts here are based on my own opinion and may not represent that of my group.

Sure, there's the argument that all that money spent shooting rockets up into space could solve world hunger.
So can all the money from, oh I don't know, nuclear weapons or something.

It's hard to know the intent behind technology.
On one hand, you can call the Mars colonization mission a hedge against the Earth system's collapse.
On the other hand, it might just be a glorified bomb shelter for the 0.01% literally taken to the extreme (to another planet)!

Where does one draw the line?
How is that not any different to me not donating to that charity in the first link?

First world problems indeed.
What is it with people, who have so much money, but who are still clueless about how privilleged they already are.
Take this [couple](https://dqydj.com/on-track-retirement-spending-goals/) practically earning 6-figures each who needs help doing retirement math.

Listen, we all have problems.
Some problems might be more noble to solve, such as deforestation, malaria, the refugee crisis, etc.

But we aren't going to be solving any of those sitting in an office all day in a job we don't like now are we?

Sure, I'm not saying we should all go on strike and go save the world.
We did jokingly decide to start a revolution that lunch, with pitchforks, fire torches and all that.
But let's be more pragmatic, which means continuing to sit (or stand if you have a standing desk) in your office all day in a job you don't like.

Hey, gotta live right?

The difference though, is to save more and spend less.
Now the details I'll leave it up to you.
Do the [math](https://dqydj.com/ideal-savings-rate-calculator-for-financial-independence-and-retirement/) and figure out when and if you're ready to be free.
Ideally, aim for the next five years or so because the world can't wait y'know.

It's definitely easier if you have less attachments.
Family, money, things.
Just know that the more you have, the more you have to lose.
At some point though, you'll need to let go of them.
Some people fear the zombie apocalypse, others fear an economic slowdown, or a natural disaster.

How are those any different?

The day before I decided to hand in my resignation letter to that no-harbour-view corporate job, I met with my PhD supervisor.
He told me: "I'm not going to tell you how to live your life, but I'll be here to offer you my advice ..., and I do think you're find graduate school very rewarding".

It was a very personal decision for me.

My mom has who-knows-how-many side gigs running in parallel to fund my sibling's education.
My dad's job is becoming uncertain with budget cuts, and he'll have to retire in a few more years anyway.
Sure, it's not exactly third world conditions but it's a struggle in a way.

Every dollar counts.
While my parents pay for my grandmother's recurring kidney dialysis expenses, I've managed to save up and pay for my sister's entire year of university tuition and living expenses.
Even with that, I'm still aiming to be financially independent by 30, if not earlier (don't tell mom)!

With that independence, I'll have no excuse to do some good.
I've interned in the public sector, done my corporate stint, and am having a taste of academia right now.
Guess the non-profit sector will be next!

I'm not here to show off.
I'm just showing you how it will be possible - to earn that independence early - step by step *as it happens*.

So back to the call to action:
We aren't going to be solving any world problems by sitting in an office all day in a job we don't like now are we?

Then let's go out there and kill those zombies!

Wait that came out wrong.

Let's go out there and demand for 5G internet!!

Hold on, one more time.

Let's go out there, and save the world!!!

1% at time.
